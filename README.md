# cyberbill image generator üöÄ

This development was heavily inspired by the excellent software Fooocus https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus, whose latest version dates back to August 2024.
Although many forks have appeared, I wanted to create a complete software almost from scratch, drawing from libraries like Gradio, Diffusers, Hugging Face (Transformers, Compel), ONNX Runtime, Rembg, etc. It also integrates specific models and techniques for image enhancement, such as ModelScope for colorization, Diffusers LDM for upscaling, and OneRestore for image restoration. It is therefore a coherent assembly of various sources, and the work of many teams whom I warmly thank.


Passionate about image generation and AI, I heavily relied on Gemini to help me... being a beginner, I learned a lot while designing this software. Like having a teacher by my side, with good foundations and determination, one can have fun and contribute to the community, however small the contribution may be.

## üìå Prerequisites
- **CUDA 12.8** installed ‚úÖ
- **Nvidia RTX Card**: Not tested on other cards.
- **8 GB of VRAM recommended**: Optimization not available for smaller graphics cards.

## üì• Installation
1.  **Download the project**
    - Choose the `zip` file or `cyberbill_SDXL.zip` and unzip it into the directory of your choice.

2.  **Install CUDA 12.8** via this [link] (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

3.  **Run the `install.bat` script**
    - This sets up the necessary environment for the software.

4.  **Start the application with `start.bat`**
    - Double-click this file to launch the user interface.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Launching the application
1.  **Double-click on `start.bat`** üéØ
    - This activates the environment and launches the application.
2.  **Or use the command line:**
    ```sh
    venv\Scripts\activate
    python cyberbill_SDXL.py
    ```



## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
### üåü Essential Steps
1.  **Load an SDXL model**
    - Place the `.safetensors` files in `models/checkpoints`.
    - Click on **"List models"**, then select the desired model.

    NOTE: The software is provided **without a model**.
    - If no model is found at launch, the program will ask if you want to load one. Answer with y or n (yes or no). The model will then be loaded. This is a generic model that yields good results: MegaChonkXL.
    - Alternatively, you can download your own models from various sources (SDXL 1.0 checkpoint models in `.safetensors` format to be placed in the `/models/checkpoints` directory).

        Example sites: [civitai.com](https://civitai.com/) | [lexica.art](https://lexica.art/) | [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co)

2.  **Configure your settings**
    - **VAE**:
        - Place your `.safetensors` files in `/models/vae/`. The vast majority of files come with an integrated VAE, so it's generally not necessary to download one... but just in case!
        - The VAE transforms the latent image into a complete and detailed version.
    - **Sampler**:
        - Select an algorithm to guide image generation (Euler, DDIM, etc.).
    - **Guidance (CFG Scale)**:
        - Determines the image's fidelity to the prompt:
            - *3-7*: Creative results.
            - *10-20*: Precise results.
    - **Steps**:
        - Recommended: around 30 for a balance between quality/speed.
    - **Seed**:
        - Use -1 for a random seed or set a fixed seed to reproduce results.
    - **Dimensions**:
        - Select a predefined format compatible with the model.
    - **Number of images**:
        - Select the number of images to generate.

3.  **Add a prompt**
    - Enter text describing the desired image.
    - Activate "Translate to English" to automate the translation.
    - By checking the box "generate a prompt from an image", you can paste or upload an image from your disk, and a prompt will then be suggested.

4.  **Generate images**
    - Click on **"Generate"**. Images are saved in the `output` folder along with an HTML report.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Prompt Enhancement (LLM) (New in 1.8.9)

The application now features an optional capability to enhance your prompts using a Language Model (LLM).

- **Activation**: Check the "Enhance prompt with AI" checkbox located below the main prompt input field.
- **How it Works**: When this option is enabled, your base prompt is sent to an LLM (by default, `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` by QwenAI, configurable in `config.json` via the `LLM_PROMPTER_MODEL_PATH` key).
- **Objective**: The LLM is instructed to generate a more detailed, descriptive, and imaginative version of your initial idea, specifically in **English**, to optimize results with image generation models like Stable Diffusion XL.
- **Resources**: To conserve your graphics card's resources (VRAM) for image generation, the LLM is configured to run on the **CPU**.
- **Output**: The AI-enhanced prompt will replace your initial prompt in the text field and will be used for generation. If the enhancement fails or does not produce a significantly different result, your original prompt will be retained.

This feature aims to help you explore new creative avenues and achieve richer, more detailed images without needing to formulate complex prompts yourself.

    - Click on **"Generate"**. Images are saved in the `output` folder along with an HTML report.

### üöÄ New: Batch Generation (tab) and batch runner (Beta 1.8)

1.  **Create a Batch Definition:**
    *   Go to the **"Batch Generator"** tab.
    *   Configure the parameters (model, VAE, prompt, styles, LoRAs, etc.) for a task.
    *   Use the "Translate Prompt to English" checkbox if needed.
    *   Click **"Add Task to Batch"**. Repeat for all desired tasks.
    *   Review the task list in the table.
    *   Click **"Generate JSON"**. The JSON file will be automatically saved in the directory specified by `SAVE_BATCH_JSON_PATH` in `config.json` (default: `Output\json_batch_files`) with a name like `batch_001.json`.

2.  **Run the Batch:**
    *   Go back to the main **"Image Generation"** tab.
    *   Expand the **"Batch Runner"** accordion.
    *   Click the file input area (or use the File Explorer if available) to **load the generated JSON file** (e.g., `batch_001.json`) from the save directory.
    *   Click **"Run Batch"**.
    *   The application will process each task sequentially, displaying progress and results. You can stop the process using the **"Stop Batch"** button.

## Learn More About Choosing Samplers:

    EulerDiscreteScheduler (Fast and detailed): A classic Euler sampler, fast and produces detailed images. Good starting point and often used for its efficiency. You already have it.
    DDIMScheduler (Fast and creative): DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models) is faster than classic methods and can be more creative, sometimes offering more varied and surprising results. Can be a good choice for rapid exploration.
    DPMSolverMultistepScheduler (Fast and high-quality): An optimized and faster version of DPM solvers. Offers a good compromise between speed and image quality, often considered one of the best choices for speed without sacrificing too much quality.

High-Quality and Photorealistic Samplers (for detailed and realistic rendering):

    DPM++ 2M Karras (Photorealistic and detailed): A high-performing sampler for obtaining photorealistic and highly detailed images. "Karras" indicates the use of an improved noise schedule (Karras noise schedule) which enhances quality. You already have it, and it's an excellent choice.
    PNDMScheduler (Stable and photorealistic): PNDM (Pseudo Numerical Methods for Diffusion Models) is stable and tends to produce photorealistic images with less noise. Can be a good choice if you are looking for a cleaner rendering.
    DPM++ SDE Karras (Photorealistic and with noise reduction): Combines the advantages of DPM++ with an SDE (Stochastic Differential Equations) method and Karras noise. Very effective for reducing noise and achieving high-quality photorealistic rendering.
    DPM++ 2M SDE Karras (Combines photorealism and noise reduction): Another variant of DPM++ SDE Karras that combines photorealism and noise reduction, possibly with slightly different characteristics from the simple DPM++ SDE Karras version.
    KDPM2DiscreteScheduler (Detailed and sharp): Another KDPM variant that tends to produce very detailed and sharp images. Good choice if you are looking for precision.

Artistic and Fluid Samplers (for a more pictorial or stylized rendering):

    Euler Ancestral (Artistic and fluid): An Euler Ancestral sampler that produces more fluid and artistic images. "Ancestral" means it adds noise at each denoising step, which can give a more pictorial look. You already have it, and it's a good choice for artistic styles.
    KDPM2AncestralDiscreteScheduler (Artistic and sharp): Combines the characteristics of KDPM2 (detailed and sharp) with the Ancestral approach (artistic). Can offer a good compromise between detail and artistic style.
    HeunDiscreteScheduler (Good speed/quality compromise): Heun is a sampler that tries to find a good balance between speed and quality, and can sometimes produce results with a softer or "painted" look.
    LMSDiscreteScheduler (Balanced and versatile): LMS (Linear Multistep Method) is a more versatile sampler that can yield good results in various styles. It is often considered a good general choice, neither too fast nor too slow, nor too specialized in a particular style.

## List of Samplers for Image Generation

This section describes the different samplers available for image generation in your tool. The choice of sampler can greatly influence the style, quality, and speed of image generation.

----

### üåà Module Notes
*   **Hugging Face Model Cache:** Models downloaded from Hugging Face (e.g., for colorization, upscaling, translation, image-to-prompt) are typically stored in the local Hugging Face cache. On Windows, this folder is often located at `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.cache\huggingface`. Managing this cache (size, cleaning) is done through Hugging Face/Transformers tools or environment variables.

*   **Model Management:** Modules like Image Enhancement load their specific models (Colorization, Upscale, Restoration) only when needed and unload them afterward to conserve VRAM. This might involve unloading the main SDXL generation model temporarily.
*   **Dependencies:** Ensure `install.bat` was run correctly to install necessary packages like `modelscope`, `diffusers`, `rembg`, etc.
*   **Configuration:** Most module settings are handled within their respective tabs in the UI. Check `config.json` for global settings like save paths.

- **Upscaling Module**:
  - Adjust the target resolution directly in the application settings.

- **Background Removal**:
  - (Configuration details might be specific to the module)

- **Image Editing**:
  - Allows importing external images and applying filters quickly.

### üîß Developing Custom Modules
The included test module provides a practical framework for developing your own modules. Here's how to proceed:
1.  **Module Structure**:
    - Each module must include a main file named `myModule_mod.py` and specific dependencies.

2.  **Configuration**:
    - Use the module's `myModule_mod.json` file to define its behaviors, parameters, and translations.

3.  **Documentation**:
    - Add clear instructions in the module's folder to guide users.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Metadata Additions

The application saves generated images with comprehensive metadata for easy management and tracking:

* **XMP Metadata**: Embedded directly within the image file, it includes key information such as the module used, author, model, VAE, generation parameters (steps, guidance, styles, prompt, etc.), image size, generation time, and the original file (in batch mode).
* **HTML Report**: An HTML file is created for each image, presenting the same metadata in a readable and user-friendly format.
* **File Name**: The image file name is constructed descriptively, including elements such as the module used, original file name (if batch), styles applied, generation date and time, and image dimensions.
